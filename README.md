For any questions or bug reports, please refer to [hid_nintendo](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/linux).

based on https://github.com/nadiaholmquist/linux/tree/hid-nintendo


## Installation

Install using the name hid-nintendo version 1.3
an install script is include but you will have to change it a bit to get it working but following the commands
shouldn't be to hard

Also note this is for personal use just because I wanted to play with my controller the day I got them
and I am sure support from a better programmer will come soon
